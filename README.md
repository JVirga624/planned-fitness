Problem Statement

Workout websites are not providing users with a friendly all-in-one experience to track progress, compare and create workouts, and utilize/build playlists. Many times, the gym can be a confusing place without having a game plan when you walk through the doors. No plan means roaming around which in turn means little to no progress.

Our solution is to create a convenient way for users to create workouts before they start their workout using a drag and drop interactive calendar. In addition, to provide a place to share/create playlists, track progress, and learn various exercises in an exercise library that they may not have tried before. The main idea behind this is to provide a complete experience for users, from beginners all the way to workout fanatics, that is right in front of you.

Goals
1. Interactive Calendar to create workouts and compare exercises to previous workouts (drag and drop)
2. Exercise library
3. Track progress with charts/graphs.
4. Area to share workout music and playlists for others
