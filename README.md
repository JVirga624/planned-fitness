Problem Statement

Workout websites are not providing users with a friendly all-in-one experience to track progress, compare and create workouts, and utilize/build playlists. Many times, the gym can be a confusing place without having a game plan when you walk through the doors. No plan means roaming around which in turn means little to no progress.

Our solution is to create a convenient way for users to create workouts before they start their workout. In addition, to provide a place to share/create playlists, track progress, and to challenge the web with workouts of their own.


(UNDER CONSTRUCTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)


By this we mean a way for users to track progress by using comparisons of previous workouts along with charts which will provide a visual representation of current fitness levels. In addition, motivation does not always stem from within or from a person standing over you while working out; instead, music is the proven go to method. Contained within the website is an area to create and share playlists with others, and/or use one for yourself. The main goal, however, is to build an interactive calendar where people can drag and drop exercises to build a workout routine for specific days because who doesn't like to have a game plan.

Goals
1. Interactive Calendar to create workouts and compare exercises to previous workouts (drag and drop)
2. Exercise library
3. Track progress with charts/graphs.
4. Area to share workout music and playlists for others
