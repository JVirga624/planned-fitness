Problem Statement

Workout websites are not providing users with a friendly all-in-one experience. By this we mean a way for users to track progress by using comparisons of previous workouts along with charts which will provide a visual representation of current fitness levels. In addition, motivation does not always stem from within or from a person standing over you while working out; instead, music is the proven go to method. Contained within the website is an area to create and share playlists with others, and/or use one for yourself. The main goal, however, is to build an interactive calendar where people can drag and drop exercises to build a workout routine for specific days because who doesn't like to have a game plan.
